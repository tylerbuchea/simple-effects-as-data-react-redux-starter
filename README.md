# Simple Effects as Data React Redux Starter

This starter is vanilla create-react-app and I've added in [effects-as-data]() plus
redux. I've kept all the Redux & EAD in one folder `effects` and kept the number of files
low so it is easy to see how everything connects. This should be a good jumping off point
for someone creating their first EAD/React/Redux app. Enjoy! :)

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Develop

```bash
npm start
```

## Test

```bash
npm test
```
